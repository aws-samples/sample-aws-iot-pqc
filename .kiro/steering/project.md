# Project Steering

## Overview

This is an Arduino sample project demonstrating how to connect an ESP32 microcontroller to AWS IoT Core using post-quantum cryptography (PQC). It uses wolfSSL for TLS 1.3 with hybrid Kyber/ML-KEM key exchange, and manages WiFi and MQTT as independent FreeRTOS tasks with automatic failure recovery.

## Tech Stack

- **Platform:** ESP32 (all WiFi-capable variants) via Arduino framework
- **IDE:** Arduino Cloud IDE (app.arduino.cc) and Arduino Desktop IDE
- **TLS Library:** wolfSSL 5.7.0+ with Kyber/ML-KEM PQC support
- **MQTT Library:** PubSubClient 2.8+
- **RTOS:** FreeRTOS (built into ESP32 Arduino core)
- **Cloud Service:** AWS IoT Core (MQTT over TLS 1.3, port 8883)
- **Authentication:** Mutual TLS with X.509 certificates

## Conventions

- Single `.ino` sketch file for Arduino Cloud IDE compatibility
- Configuration and credentials isolated in `secrets.h` (never commit real values)
- wolfSSL compile-time configuration documented in `wolfssl_user_settings.h` (reference only, not included directly)
- FreeRTOS tasks use `xTaskCreatePinnedToCore` with explicit stack sizes
- Serial output uses structured prefixes: `[WiFi]`, `[MQTT]`, `[wolfSSL]`, `[Setup]`
- All timing constants defined as `#define` at the top of the sketch for easy tuning
- Use inclusive language in all code, comments, and documentation (see inclusivity rules)
- C-style code following Arduino conventions (camelCase for functions, g_ prefix for globals)
